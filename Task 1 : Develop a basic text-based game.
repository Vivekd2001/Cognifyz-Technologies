Task 1 : Develop a basic text-based game.

Objective: Implement a simple game using
conditional statements for game logic.


Solution : 

import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class GuessingGame {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random random = new Random();
        int numberToGuess = random.nextInt(10) + 1;
        int attempts = 0;
        boolean guessedCorrectly = false;

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Guessing Game!");
        System.out.println("I have chosen a number between 1 and 10. Can you guess what it is?");

        while (!guessedCorrectly) {
            System.out.print("Enter your guess (1-10): ");
            
            if (!scanner.hasNextInt()) {
                System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 10.");
                scanner.next();
                continue;
            }

            int guess = scanner.nextInt();
            attempts++;

            if (guess < numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("Too low! Try again.");
            } else if (guess > numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("Too high! Try again.");
            } else {
                guessedCorrectly = true;
                System.out.println("Congratulations! You've guessed the number in " + attempts + " attempts.");
            }
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}

Output : 

Welcome to the Guessing Game!
I have chosen a number between 1 and 10. Can you guess what it is?
Enter your guess (1-10): 4
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess (1-10): 3
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess (1-10): 2
Congratulations! You've guessed the number in 3 attempts.
